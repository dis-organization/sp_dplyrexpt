I'm very interested to see if we could seamlessly allow these tbl_df objects with existing code, it looks like we can as long as our tests are based on inherits and methods like dim/nrow etc. I'm also interested in next generation rewrites, and keen to chat about it soon. I'll try to get my thoughts down and share 

## Goals 

- more consistent spatial classes
- bbox/extent must have a CRS
- CRS is wkt
- any dim-consistent object allowed (matrix, df, tbl_df)
- flexible build functions, focus on best-guess rather than strict

## sp with dplyr

Basic tests. 

```{r}
library(sp)
library(dplyr)
df <- data.frame(x = 1:10, y = rnorm(10), a = letters[1:10])
d_f <- as_data_frame(df)

data(meuse.grid)
meuse_grid <- as_data_frame(meuse.grid)
m = SpatialPixelsDataFrame(points = meuse_grid[c("x", "y")], data = meuse_grid)
meuse_pts <- SpatialPointsDataFrame(SpatialPoints(as.matrix(meuse_grid[, c("x", "y")])), meuse_grid)
gridded(meuse_pts) <- TRUE
fullgrid(meuse_pts) <- TRUE


new("SpatialPointsDataFrame", SpatialPoints(as.matrix(d_f[,1:2])), data = d_f)
new("SpatialGridDataFrame", )
coordinates(d_f) <- c("x", "y")

 
 
 library(dplyr)
 library(sp)
 library(foreign)
 d_f <- as_data_frame(read.dbf(system.file("vectors", "cities.dbf",  package = "rgdal"), as.is = TRUE))
 pts <- matrix(rnorm(nrow(d_f) * 2), ncol = 2)
 
 sp_dplyr <- new("SpatialPointsDataFrame", SpatialPoints(pts), data = d_f)
 ```
